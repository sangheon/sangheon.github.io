I am Sangheon Kim (he/him).<br> 
I work in the HotSpot GC team at Oracle and I spend most of my working hours contributing to OpenJDK.

I will use this blog to share my implementations and English->Korean translation of Garbage Collector updates in OpenJDK. The views in the blog are personal and might not be shared by my employer.

You can reach me at <a href="mailto:sangheon.kim@oracle.com">sangheon.kim@oracle.com</a>.
