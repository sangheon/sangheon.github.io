I am Sangheon Kim (he/him).<br> 
I work in the HotSpot GC team at Oracle and most of time I contribute to OpenJDK.

I will use this blog to share my implementations and English->Korean translation of Garbage Collector updates in OpenJDK. The views in the blog are personal and might not be shared by my employer.
